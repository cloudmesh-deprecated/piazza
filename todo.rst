TODO
----

- [ ] by conversion of the print statuements, errors may have been
  introduced, check all print statements

- [X] make it possible to easily define the mongodb port as it may be that something else runs on default port
- [X] mkdir piazza in /home in quickstart
- [ ] document the configuration, maybe we can have default config file and than we edit to bypass quickstart, but I like quickstart also

FIXME
-----

- [ ] mongo install does not work on OSX (Gregor)
- [ ] currently instructor and students collective answers are ignored (create option so this can be included or excluded)
- [ ] search "everything" remove duplicates

ANALYSE CURRENT CLASS AS EXAMPLE
--------------------------------

- [ ] figure out how we create good looking report based on script we create for analysis (possibly using ipynb)
- [ ] distribution of who posted most includes people that did not post (Tim note: Need admin privileges in Piazza for this, I cannot retrieve users who did not post)
- [X] distribution of participation in folders folders. LIst all people that posted, list all people that did not post
- [ ] list "special"post" to indicate specific actions. Such as who asked for extended access to gitlab, incomplete, ...
- [X] piazza list <postnumber>  while postnumber uses hostlists to manage multiple comma separated numbers
- [ ] you showed me some cool things, maybe add them here so we do that.
